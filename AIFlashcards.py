                                          2. For each key word, provide a detailed definition that includes relevant contextâ€”even if that context is not explicitly mentioned in the PDF.
                                          3. Output your results as a numbered list, strictly following this format:

                          Make sure that the output contains only the numbered list and nothing else.

        This method takes information from a gemini call and initializes it in a dictionary object.

            The key of the dictionary is the number of the word.
            The value is a dictionary itself.
            The key of the sub dictionary is the word.
            The value of the sub dictionary is the definition.
