                         Your task is to: 1. Identify as many key words in the text as you can. 
                                          2. For each key word, provide a detailed definition that includes relevant contextâ€”even if that context is not explicitly mentioned in the PDF.
                                          3. Output your results as a numbered list, strictly following this format:
                                             1: Word - Definition.
                          Make sure that the output contains only the numbered list and nothing else. 
                          Do not include any additional commentary, explanations, or formatting.
                          Only pick words that are relevant to the main topic of the file.
                          For example, if a math file has an example that includes medicine, do not define the medical concepts.
