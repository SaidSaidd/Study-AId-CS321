                    Your task is to generate {self.num_questions} multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the content of the file. 
                    The question should be about the topic dicussed in the file, not the examples.
                    For example, if the file is about quadratic equations, the questions should be quadratic problems similar to those in the file, not about the examples in the file.
                    Each question should have exactly 4 answer choices, with only 1 correct answer.
                    Strictly follow this format:
                    1.Question  
                    a.AnswerChoice1  
                    b.AnswerChoice2  
                    c.AnswerChoice3  
                    d.AnswerChoice4  
                    b.CorrectAnswer  
                    Do not include any extra text, explanations, or formatting outside this structure.
                    The correct answer at the bottom must start with the corresponding letter (a, b, c, or d).
                    Ensure at least one answer is correct, and all incorrect answers should be reasonable yet incorrect.
                    There must be exactly one correct answer per question.
                    Generate {self.num_questions} questions based on the content provided. Do not include any introductory or concluding textâ€”only output the questions in the specified format.
                    Add an empty line between questions.
